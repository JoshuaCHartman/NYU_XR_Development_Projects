# NYU XR & 3D Graphics Development Projects
 Projects completed as part of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering XR Development and 3D Graphics course.
 
 ## Week 7 - UI & Animation
 - Isometric Adventure :
 - - Chest animates open/close when player enters trigger zone.
 - - Animations are both premade and keyframe generated.
 
 
- UI / Game Menu :
- - Start Menu (scene index 0) with buttons to launch 3 scenes each encompassing a different game.
- - Each game contans a Pause menu, with options to return to the present game, or go back to the Main Menu.
 
## Week 6 - Scripting for Interaction
- Roll-A-Ball :
- - Physics-based control of player. 
- - Scripted interaction includes collectibles/pick-ups, application of physics forces, updating respawn checkpoints, moving obstacles, and simple particle effects.
- - Camera rotates around ball with right mouse button, at fixed offset follow position. Camera follows at offset when not held down.

- First Person Explorer :
- - Mouse & keyboard controls using Unity's new Input System, with mouse sensitivty adjustmeny.
- - Physics-based player movement.
- - Scripted interaction with environment - opening doors, jump pads.
- - Scripted logic for gates to close after player exits trigger space, regardless of starting configuration (open/closed).

## Week 5 - C# Scripting 
- 3D Platformer :
- - Standalone installer for executable.
- - Scripts to control platform movement (editable in the Inspector), and collectibles rotation. 
- - Creation of custom materials with automatic opacity shifting defined by script, and editable in the Inspector. 
- - Instantiation of prefabs after collectibles gathered. 
- - Creation of additional playable area using a variety of rigidbody physics and joints, a scripted teleport system, scripted TextMeshPro controls, etc. 

## Week 4 - Unity Basics
- Rube Goldberg Machine :
- - Use the 3d physics engine to creaete a complicated machine. 
- Features : 
- - Starts without user input using only physics. 
- - Custom physics materials, and application of joints. 
- - Simple script creates a field to alter gameplay time. 
- - Six freely moving platforms/stations. 

- Primitives Gallery - working with 3D primitives and tags.
