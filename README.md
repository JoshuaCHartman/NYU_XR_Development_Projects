# NYU XR & 3D Graphics Development Projects
 Projects completed as part of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering XR Development and 3D Graphics course.
 
## Week 6 - Scripting for Interaction
- Roll-A-Ball:
- - Physics-based control of player 
- - Scripted interaction includes collectibles/pick-ups, application of physics forces, updating respawn checkpoints, moving obstacles, and simple particle effects
- - Camera rotates around ball with right mouse button, at fixed offset follow position. Camera follows at offset when not held down.

- First Person
- - Mouse & keyboard controls using Unity's new Input System, with mouse sensitivty adjustment
- - Physics-based player movement
- - Scripted interaction with environment - opening doors, jump pads
- - Scripted logic for gates to close after player exits trigger space, regardless of starting configuration (open/closed)

## Week 5 - C# Scripting 
- 3D Platformer :
- Standalone installer for executable.
- Scripts to control platform movement (editable in the Inspector), and collectibles rotation. 
- Creation of custom materials with automatic opacity shifting defined by script, and editable in the Inspector. 
- Instantiation of prefabs after collectibles gathered. 
- Creation of additional playable area using a variety of rigidbody physics and joints, a scripted teleport system, scripted TextMeshPro controls, etc. 

## Week 4 - Unity Basics
- Rube Goldberg Machine - using the 3d physics engine to creaete a complicated machine. Features : starts without user input using only physics, custom physics materials, joints, simple script creating a field to alter gameplay time, six freely moving platforms/stations. 
- Primitives Gallery - working with 3D primitives and tags
